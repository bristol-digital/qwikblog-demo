# QwikBlog

A simple, file-based blog for Laravel — headless front-end + lightweight admin
with a Livewire-powered image gallery and a WYSIWYG body editor. No database
required. Posts live in `resources/posts/` as Markdown files with YAML front
matter.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> my-blog
cd my-blog
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Set admin credentials in `.env` (see [Configuration](#configuration)), then in
two terminals:

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite watcher
php artisan serve    # or visit your-site.test if using Valet
```

Visit `/` to see the blog. Visit `/admin` to log in.

To populate with the bundled flamenco demo content (12 posts across 4
categories with images):

```bash
php artisan blog:examples flamenco
```

## Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` and `/blog` | Post index — both serve the same content |
| `/blog/{slug}` | Single post **or** category filter **or** tag filter (resolves in that order) |
| `/blog/search?q=...` | Full-text search results |
| `/blog/author/{slug}` | All posts by an author |
| `/blog/{year}` | All posts from a year |
| `/blog/{year}/{month}` | All posts from a month (e.g. `/blog/2024/11`) |
| `/blog/category/{slug}` | Category filter — explicit prefix, always works |
| `/blog/tag/{slug}` | Tag filter — explicit prefix, always works |
| `/blog/feed.xml` | RSS 2.0 feed |
| `/sitemap.xml` | XML sitemap |

Public views live at `resources/views/blog/index.blade.php` and
`show.blade.php`. Both extend the host site's `app.blade.php` layout. The
package ships a starter `app.blade.php`; host sites typically have their
own and only need `@stack('head')` somewhere in `<head>` for SEO meta to
inject correctly.

## Post fields

Posts are stored as `resources/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`. Front matter:

```yaml
---
title: My First Post
subtitle: An optional subtitle
summary: Short excerpt — used on listings.
categories: Announcements, News
tags: launch, hello-world
hero_image: /images/blog/my-first-post/1.jpg
author: Jane Editor
date: 2024-11-15 10:00:00
---

Markdown body goes here.
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `title` | yes | Determines the URL slug |
| `subtitle` | no | Shown on cards and post header |
| `summary` | yes | Short excerpt for listings, OG description |
| `categories` | no | Comma-separated; multi-valued |
| `tags` | no | Comma-separated; multi-valued |
| `hero_image` | no | Path under `public/`; falls back to first gallery image |
| `author` | yes | Byline; links to `/blog/author/{slug}` |
| `date` | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`; future = scheduled |

The admin writes this format automatically. The legacy singular `category:`
field is still read for back-compat with older posts.

## Categories and tags

Posts can have any number of each. Both render in the right-rail sidebar
on the index page (categories as a vertical list, tags inline as
`#hashtag` chips), each with a post count. Active filter is highlighted.

| URL | Result |
|-----|--------|
| `/` or `/blog` | All published posts |
| `/blog/palos` | Posts in **Palos** (flat URL style, the default) |
| `/blog/category/palos` | Same — explicit prefix; always works regardless of style |
| `/blog/gitano` | Posts tagged **gitano** |
| `/blog/tag/gitano` | Same — explicit prefix |

One filter at a time — clicking a different chip replaces the active
filter rather than stacking with AND. Each post's own categories and tags
also appear in the show-page sidebar with counts.

If no published post has any categories, the categories section hides
entirely. Same for tags. The view checks `count(...) > 0` before
rendering.

### URL collision

Posts win on slug collision. A post titled "Palos" would shadow the Palos
category filter at `/blog/palos`. If you need strict separation, set
`QWIKBLOG_TAXONOMY_URL_STYLE=prefixed` — chip links then go to
`/blog/category/palos` etc. and never collide with post slugs.

## Scheduling

Set `date` to a future timestamp. The post will:

- Show in the admin index with a yellow **Scheduled** badge and a relative
  countdown ("in 3 weeks") that updates on the 30-second `wire:poll`
- Be hidden from the public `/blog` until the date passes
- Return 404 at its slug to public visitors but render normally for
  logged-in admins (preview)
- Auto-publish silently when the date arrives — no cron job required

## Search

`/blog/search?q=...` runs an AND match across title, subtitle, summary,
author, categories, tags, and rendered body content. Multi-term queries
are supported (`jerez bulerías` returns posts containing both terms).
Pure-PHP `str_contains` — fine up to a few thousand posts; past that, swap
in a real index.

Search results pages are `noindex` by default — every unique query is a
unique URL and not worth indexing.

## Author pages

`/blog/author/{slug}` lists every published post by an author. The author
byline on each show page links here automatically.

## Archive

`/blog/{year}` and `/blog/{year}/{month}` return posts from that period.
The sidebar archive nav appears when at least 2 distinct months are
represented; below that it stays hidden (a single-month archive is just
the index).

## Related posts

Each post page shows up to 3 related posts at the bottom, scored by
taxonomy overlap:

```
score = (shared_tags × 2) + (shared_categories × 1)
```

Posts scoring 0 are excluded entirely — better to hide the section than
show weak recommendations. Weights and limit are configurable.

## RSS, sitemap, SEO

| Feature | Where |
|---------|-------|
| RSS 2.0 feed | `/blog/feed.xml` (most recent 50 posts) |
| Sitemap | `/sitemap.xml` (every post + filter URL + author + archive) |
| Autodiscovery `<link>` | In every page's `<head>` |
| Open Graph + Twitter Card | On every post page |
| Canonical URL | Every page |
| Reading time | "X min read" on post pages, computed at 200 wpm by default |
| Robots noindex | Search results, scheduled-post admin previews |

Reference the sitemap from `public/robots.txt`:

```
Sitemap: https://your-site.test/sitemap.xml
```

## Image gallery

Each post has its own folder at `public/images/blog/{slug}/`. Images are
numbered `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, … and ordering is set by the numeric filename.

The Livewire gallery (`/admin/posts/{slug}/images`) lets you:

- Drag-and-drop upload (multi-select, JPG/PNG/GIF, max 20 MB each)
- Resize and re-orient automatically (max 1600×1200, 85% quality JPG; GIFs
  pass through untouched so animations are preserved)
- Reorder images by drag
- Delete individual images
- Copy a path to the clipboard for pasting into the post's `hero_image` field

If `hero_image` is left blank in the front matter, the first numerically-
named image is used automatically. Set it explicitly to override.

When a post is renamed, its image folder moves with it. When a post is
deleted, its image folder is deleted too.

On the public show page, multiple images render as a crossfading carousel
with prev/next, dot navigation, a counter, and a thumbnail strip.

## Body editor (WYSIWYG)

The admin's body field uses [Toast UI Editor](https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor),
defaulting to WYSIWYG mode with a Markdown toggle in the toolbar. The
editor is bundled via Vite (`resources/js/admin.js`) — no CDN dependency
at runtime. Posts are stored as plain CommonMark, so files remain
hand-editable.

## Admin

A small, session-authenticated admin lives at `/admin` (or whatever path
you set via `QWIKBLOG_ADMIN_PATH`).

Set credentials in `.env`:

```dotenv
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

If either is empty, login is refused — there is no default password.

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/admin/login` | Login form |
| `/admin` → `/admin/posts` | Posts index (Livewire — search, filters, pagination, polls every 30s) |
| `/admin/posts/create` | New post |
| `/admin/posts/{slug}/edit` | Edit post |
| `/admin/posts/{slug}/images` | Manage images (Livewire) |

The admin uses session auth via the `AdminAuth` middleware (alias `admin`
registered in `bootstrap/app.php`). Sessions are file-based by default
(`SESSION_DRIVER=file`), so no database is required.

### Filtering

The admin posts index has four filters that combine with AND:

| Filter | What it matches |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Search** | Title, subtitle, summary, author. Debounced 300ms |
| **Category** | Single category — drop-down of every category across all posts |
| **Tag** | Single tag |
| **Status** | All / Published / Scheduled |

Filter state is preserved in the URL — `/admin/posts?status=scheduled&category=Palos`
is bookmarkable and reload-safe. The header shows totals
(`12 published · 3 scheduled · 15 total`); the **Status** dropdown shows
the same counts inline so editors can find scheduled posts without first
applying a filter.

Page paginates at 30 by default — useful when scheduling content months
ahead. Override via `QWIKBLOG_ADMIN_PER_PAGE`.

Scheduled rows show their relative publish time underneath the date
("in 3 weeks"), updating on the 30-second `wire:poll`.

## Bulk import

For migrating content or seeding test data:

```bash
php artisan blog:import path/to/manifest.php
```

The manifest is a `.php` file returning an array (recommended for long
bodies — heredoc is friendlier than JSON-escaping) or `.json`.

```php
<?php
return [
    [
        'title' => 'My Imported Post',
        'date' => '2025-01-15',
        'subtitle' => '...',
        'summary' => '...',
        'categories' => ['News'],
        'tags' => ['launch'],
        'author' => 'Jane Editor',
        'hero_image_url' => 'https://example.com/photo.jpg',
        'gallery_image_urls' => [
            'https://example.com/photo-2.jpg',
        ],
        'body' => <<<'MD'
# Markdown body here
MD,
    ],
];
```

Image URLs (when present) are downloaded into `public/images/blog/{slug}/`
at import time. Failures are non-fatal — posts are still created.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview without writing |
| `--skip-images` | Create posts, skip downloads |
| `--overwrite` | Replace any existing post with a matching slug |

## Example post sets

Bundled example sets live in `resources/seeds/{name}-posts.php`:

```bash
php artisan blog:examples flamenco
```

| Set | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `flamenco` | 12 educational posts about flamenco — palos, history, compás, maestros |

Same flags as `blog:import` (`--overwrite`, `--skip-images`, `--dry-run`).

To list available sets: `php artisan blog:examples nonexistent` shows
what's in `resources/seeds/`. To add your own, drop `<name>-posts.php`
into that directory and it's runnable as `php artisan blog:examples <name>`.

## Customising the look

The public-facing views (`resources/views/blog/index.blade.php`,
`show.blade.php`) use Vite-built Tailwind. Article body styling uses the
[Tailwind Typography plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)
— the `prose` class on `<article>` is the source of truth.

The index uses a 5-column grid on desktop (4 columns of posts + a thinner
sidebar column with categories, archive, tags, search). Sidebar widgets
sit in `bg-gray-100` cards. Stacks to a single column on mobile.

The admin uses CDN Tailwind to stay self-contained, plus a Vite-bundled
JS file (`resources/js/admin.js`) that provides Toast UI Editor.

## Configuration

All package configuration lives in `config/qwikblog.php` and reads from
`.env` overrides. Every value is optional except admin credentials.

| Env var | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | — | **Required.** Admin login |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | — | **Required.** Admin login |
| `QWIKBLOG_POSTS_PATH` | `resources/posts` | Where the .md post files live |
| `QWIKBLOG_CACHE_DURATION` | `3600` | Post cache TTL in seconds |
| `QWIKBLOG_LANGUAGE` | app locale | RSS feed `<language>` tag |
| `QWIKBLOG_READING_WPM` | `200` | Words per minute for "X min read" |
| `QWIKBLOG_PER_PAGE` | `12` | Posts per page on public blog |
| `QWIKBLOG_ADMIN_PER_PAGE` | `30` | Posts per page in admin table |
| `QWIKBLOG_FEED_LIMIT` | `50` | Max items in RSS feed |
| `QWIKBLOG_ADMIN_PATH` | `admin` | Admin URL prefix |
| `QWIKBLOG_TAXONOMY_URL_STYLE` | `flat` | `flat` (`/blog/{slug}`) or `prefixed` (`/blog/category/{slug}`) |
| `QWIKBLOG_RELATED_TAG_WEIGHT` | `2` | Related-post tag weight |
| `QWIKBLOG_RELATED_CATEGORY_WEIGHT` | `1` | Related-post category weight |
| `QWIKBLOG_RELATED_LIMIT` | `3` | Number of related posts shown |

After editing `.env`:

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

Clears config, route, view and compiled caches in one go. Required if
you've previously run `php artisan config:cache` or are deployed in a way
that caches config.

To verify a value is being read:

```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="dump(config('qwikblog.per_page'));"
```

If the value comes back as the default when you've set the env var,
either `config/qwikblog.php` isn't at the project root, the env var is
mistyped (case-sensitive), or config is still cached.

## Cache

Posts are cached for an hour. To clear manually:

```bash
php artisan blog:refresh
```

The admin clears this cache automatically on every create/update/delete,
and `blog:import` clears it after a bulk import.

## Common commands

```bash
# Dev
npm run dev
php artisan serve

# After editing post files directly
php artisan blog:refresh

# After dropping in new components, commands or config
php artisan view:clear
php artisan optimize:clear

# Production build
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Stale post data after editing files directly | `php artisan blog:refresh` |
| 500 with "undefined property" or "undefined method" on `BlogPost` | Cached `BlogPost` doesn't match the current class shape — `php artisan blog:refresh` |
| Admin pages 500 with "Unable to locate component" | Stale view cache. `php artisan view:clear` |
| WYSIWYG editor doesn't load | Browser console says "Toast UI Editor not found on window" — run `npm install && npm run dev` |
| `/admin` shows "Admin credentials are not configured" | Set both `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, then `php artisan optimize:clear` |
| `QWIKBLOG_*` env var seems ignored | `php artisan optimize:clear`. Verify with `php artisan tinker --execute="dump(config('qwikblog.per_page'));"` |
| Image upload "browse and nothing happens" | Duplicate Alpine load. Make sure no `<script src=".../alpine...">` is in the admin layout — Livewire bundles its own |
